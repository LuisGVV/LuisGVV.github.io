When you suck or feel stuck in any personal goal it isn't because you are useless or dumb.

You haven't mastered the basics up to a degree where you do them unconsciously or with much effort.

Look at any area of your life:

- Money
- Health
- Job & Career

### Money

Do you feel like you don't have enough money, live paycheck to paycheck, drowning in debts?

Probably you lack the simple skill of planning and budgeting. [^1].

Planning and budgeting also encompasses other sub-set of skills such as basic arithmetic, cash flow, decision making, priorities and setting goals.

Look around at any acquaintance who is crying about being broke and borrowing money from their relatives 2 days before pay day. Probably they don't plan or budget, go on shopping streaks, swipe their card mindlessly for things that they don't really _need_, sign up for a cellphone plan without even knowing how much of their paycheck will be left.

Yes, not everyone will be driving the newest cool car just by opening up an excel spreadsheet but at least you won't be part of the _rich poor_. Resource planning will save your ass from dumb decisions, voracious debt and the stress of having your account drop to 0 without even having money for real emergencies.

Learn to live with what you really need.

### Health

Feel that fat in your belly and tired after a long walk?

It's the result of your eating & non-existing excercise routine and of course everyone _knows it_ yet they don't do a damn thing about it.

- Being healthy requires:
   - Food: staying away from 
   - Excercise

But eating one salad, and going for a run once a month doesn't do the work. Being healthy boils down to enforcing the habit and creating a system that you can get used to and is hard shatter.

### Job & Career

Having a decent job or not being unemployed requires working on yourself.

Yourself being:
-Knowing how to market yourself: don't say things that will make you look bad and brush your teeth (ha!)
-Being able to network and communicate effectively: this doesn't mean being extroverted and leading conversations, just knowing how to express what's going on inside your head without sounding like a douche!
-Validate the skills you have: set up a gallery, take a course and then practice so you can show off what you've been doing.

Many people around in the work force don't even practice the basic skills required for a job posting. They want to have the job right on the spot without even practicing or being efficient on the core skills that a career demands.

### In short

Having something in life requires some degree of repetition & mastering the simplest tasks that in the end add to the final result.

[^1]: You could argue that you also have an income problem. I won't go in depth in that argument since it's pretty much a gray area for everyone and I'm no entrepeneur/hustler type.
